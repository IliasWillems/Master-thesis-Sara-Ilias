# Master thesis Sara & Ilias
This is the repository containing the code used in *Yeo-Johnson transformation of a dependent censoring model with endogenous variables*. The folder `Data` contains the data used in one of the two data applications of the paper (JTPA data set). The JTPA data set is a cleaned version of the one that can be found on https://www.upjohn.org/data-tools/employment-research-data-center/national-jtpa-study. To see how the data set has been cleaned, we refer to https://github.com/GillesCrommen/DCC. The data set collected by the HIP Breast Cancer Screening Trial that is used in the competing risks data application is not freely available and hence not included in the `Data` folder. It can be requested via the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The folder `Figures` contains all the figures used in the paper.

The code for Chapter 3 - 4 and 6 of the thesis is indicated by the suffix `_ad`. The code used in the other chapters can be found in the similarly named folders. Finally, the script `check.integral.R` was used to numerically check the validity of our solutions for the integrals of Chapter 7.
