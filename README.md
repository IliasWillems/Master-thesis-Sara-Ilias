# Master thesis Sara & Ilias
This is the repository containing the code used in *Yeo-Johnson transformation of a dependent censoring model with endogenous variables*. The folder `Data` contains the data used in the two data applications of the paper (JTPA data set and chess data set). The folder `Figures` contains all the figures used in the paper.

The code for the main part of the thesis (Chapter 2 - 5) is indicated by the suffix `_ad`. The code used in the other chapters can be found in the similarly named folders. Finally, the script `check.integral.R` was used to numerically check the validity of our solutions for the integrals of Chapter 6.
