# Master thesis Sara & Ilias
This is the repository containing the code used in *Yeo-Johnson transformation of a dependent censoring model with endogenous variables*. The folder `Data` contains the data used in two out of three data applications of the paper (JTPA data set and chess data set). The data used in the competing risks data application is not freely available and hence not included in the `Data` folder. The folder `Figures` contains all the figures used in the paper.

The code for the main part of the thesis (Chapter 2 - 6) is indicated by the suffix `_ad`. The code used in the other chapters can be found in the similarly named folders. Finally, the script `check.integral.R` was used to numerically check the validity of our solutions for the integrals of Chapter 7.
